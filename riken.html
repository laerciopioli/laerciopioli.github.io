								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rikennode.PNG" alt="" /></span><div class="box">
									<h3>Abstract</h3>	<p>"With the exponential growth of computational power, data-intensive computing and petascale scientific applications are consuming a large amounts of processing and resources. In light of this, power management becomes a big issue for this kind of environment that needs to manage the correct spend of energy consumption. These applications are normally a kind of parallel computing applications, which use techniques, to improve the performance, data processing, post-hoc analysis and visualization. Usually, these applications need to accesses the storage device to save or manage information, which implies a high IO request rate, increasing then the energy consumption. High energy consumption is one of the most important issues in HPC environments. Multiple directions are being proposed by researchers to minimize these power challenge in HPC environments. Some of these directions are: 1) processing power needed by applications, 2) correct management of data and hardware to enhance power usage, 3) scheduling of tasks, 4) fault-tolerance mecanism throught checkpointing-restart in HPC environments among others. As we can see, these studies are being developed in HPC environments, but it's still necessary these energy-aware consumption be extended and managed in HPV scenario. This study focuses on the energy aware in High Performance Computing as well as High Performance Visualization environments proposing an approach that colaborates with green computing paradigms"</p>

							<h2>RIKEN HPC Youth Workshop</h2>
							<div class="box">
								<p>After the Symposion, we concentrate our efforts on the RIKEN HPC Youth Workshop. In the figure disposed below I'm (big hair, red sweater and back to the photo) discussing with my group wich techniques and solutions we would construct considering a problem their presented to us at moment. <span class="image right"><img src="images/YWS2018_GroupWork.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
								<p>From Friday, February 15 to Sunday, February 17, 2019, the RIKEN Center for Computational Science held the third annual RIKEN R-CCS HPC Youth Workshop. This workshop, which began in the fiscal year of 2016, provides students and young researchers interested in computational science and technology with the chance to interact and gain knowledge from one another.</p>
								<p>During this international workshop, a group of 25 individuals refined their abilities to communicate and present research in English through a series of presentations and discussions. The workshop was attended by young researchers and students, both domestic and international, and provided ample opportunities for networking and relationship-building amongst the participants.</p>
								<p>The initial portion of the workshop commenced with each participant introducing themselves. This was then followed by a poster and discourse session with the objective of strengthening the ties between all participants. The following day, the workshop included a Senior Talk by R-CCS Deputy Director Sato. Later that day, all participants were separated into smaller groups with two R-CCS researchers acting as mentors, to discuss and agree on a theme for the following day's presentation. The final day of the workshop consisted of a wrap-up meeting, where each group gave their own presentation.</p>
