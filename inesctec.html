									<h1>Exchange at<br />
									INESCTEC</h1>

								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/inesctec.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In this research exchange I had the opportunity in working in of the biggest portuguese scientific institute for tecnology of systems & computing engineering, technology and science.</p>
									

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/laercio.png" alt="" /></span>      INESC TEC is a non-profit research association that operates privately and holds Public Interest status. Its primary focus is on the development of technology and scientific research, as well as technology transfer, advanced consultancy services, and training. Additionally, it assists in the pre-incubation phase of newly emerged technology-based companies.
									INESC TEC, an establishment situated at the intersection of academia, public administration, businesses, and society, functions by uniting these various entities. As such, it frequently employs the knowledge and outcomes produced by its research in technology transfer initiatives, with the goal of creating value and producing immediate social impact.
									INESC TEC's 13 R&D Centres are organized based on four thematic domains: Computer Science, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Networked Intelligent Systems, and Power and Energy.
									At INESC TEC, there are more than 700 researchers integrated into the institution. This is composed of roughly 350 individuals with PhDs, as well as staff researchers, Higher Education Institution researchers, grant recipients, and affiliated researchers.

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/inesctec_1.JPG" alt="" /></span>
									I took a place on the Visual Computing & machine Intelligence Research Goup - VCMI under supervision of professor HÃ©lder Oliveira.
									There, I investigated how to use eXplanaible AI to understand the model decision in classifying lung cancer.
									An important information is that Deep Learning (DL) models works as a <i>black boxes</i> and the reasons for a classification decision is not presented for the interesteds.
									The model can take periferical or central pixel informations to take a decision in classyfying such object.
									Therefore, understanding how a model works and which characteristics it tooks into consideration for classifying is an important subject of research.
									</p>
									<p>Below it is possible to observe two works (i) the work I was proposed to research (ii) the journal club at VCMI event I presented. Feel free to read and if any doubt send me an email :)</p>
