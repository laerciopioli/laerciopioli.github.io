									<h2><a href="#">Who is Laércio Pioli Junior?<br /></a></h2>									
									<p>
										Laércio Pioli is a Computer Science Ph.D. researcher at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) Brazil. 
										He earned a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF).						   
									 </p>
									 <p>
										Currently, in his doctorate, he is concentrating his efforts on how to store data sensors used in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. 
										More specifically, he is studying how to use Artificial intelligence models to reduce the quantity of generated data from sensors on the edge of the network without losing accuracy performance.
									 </p>
									 <p>
										In his master's research, he investigated the storage system of high computing power environments, 
										such as Big Data, Computational Grid, and High-performance Computing (HPC). 
										For his evaluation, he carried out experiments in the Grid5000 located in france.						    
										There, he evaluated how the I/O performance improvements were being conducted and how the energy was spent on those storage environments. 						    
										This study was presented at the first R-CCS International Symposium of the largest research center (RIKEN) in Japan in February 2019. 
			 
									 </p>
									 <p>
										In his bachelor's, he focused his study on storage system technologies and data analysis. 
										More specifically, he worked with a graph database, the Neo4j, to store graph relations and knowledge. 
										To analyze these data, data analysis, and complex network analysis theory were employed in his final bachelor's work.
